Network Traffic Capture & Protocol Analysis Report

Task Name:
Task 5 – Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

Objective:
The main objective of this task was to use Wireshark to capture live network traffic 
and identify at least 3 different network protocols.

Tools Used:
- Wireshark (for packet capture and analysis)
- Browser & CMD (to generate traffic)

Methodology (Steps I followed):
1. Installed Wireshark and started capturing on my active Wi-Fi interface.
2. Used CMD to run `ping google.com` and also opened a few websites like google.com and bing.com.
3. After 30–40 seconds of capturing, I stopped the capture.
4. Applied filters such as dns, tcp, udp, http to identify different protocols.
5. Saved the final capture file in `.pcapng` format.
6. Took screenshots showing clear evidence of different protocols.

Protocols Identified (4 total):
1. ARP – Resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses, used in local network communication.
2. DNS – Converts domain names (like google.com) to IP addresses.
3. TCP – A reliable transport protocol used for web traffic; observed handshake and ACK.
4. UDP/QUIC – Fast, connectionless transport protocol; observed in DNS and encrypted QUIC traffic.

Files Included in Submission:
- task5-capture.pcapng – Packet capture file saved from Wireshark.
- README.md – Report in markdown format.
- screenshots/ – 4 screenshots showing filtered protocols (ARP, DNS, TCP, UDP).

Learning Outcome:
This task gave me practical experience with real-time packet capturing and protocol analysis.
I learned how to use Wireshark effectively, apply filters, and understand network communication protocols.
